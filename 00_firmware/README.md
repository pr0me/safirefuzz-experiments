# Firmware samples

This is the collection of firmware samples used during the SAFIREFUZZ experiments.

## Notes

- SAFIREFUZZ does not require the elf files; they are solely included to allow easy setup for [fuzzware](../01_fuzzing/fuzzware.)
- For the `p2im_plc` firmware sample, we follow HALucinator's terminology, i.e., the `p2im_plc` sample in this repository corresponds to [this](https://github.com/ucsb-seclab/hal-fuzz/tree/master/tests/p2im_controllino_slave) firmware sample of the HALucinator repository.
